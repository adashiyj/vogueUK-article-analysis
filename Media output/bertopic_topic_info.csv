But they don\'t want to be one of THOSE girls. They want to be a cool girl who is above it all, while still having it all. The problem isn\'t having a boyfriend so much as caring more about what we look like online than how we view ourselves or those we love. It\'s just not trendy to have a boyfriend anymore. The Vogue article states it outright. It\'s not that women are tired of being in bad relationships, they\'re just trying to chase what\'s fashionable for likes. Happy girlfriends are considered traitors by the feminist movement. The bottom line is they feel guilty having a boyfriend, not because they don\'t want their single friends to feel less than, but because it\'s the ""normie"" thing to do. Being heterosexual, wanting a boyfriend, husband, even kids, is viewed as conservative, and distasteful, because Democrats have sold themselves as the party of single WOMEN and the LGBT. Straight men need not apply, and being seen with those same men is now seen as fraternizing with the enemy.', 'It\'s trendy to be single or lesbian, but people still want to share their lives a little, and yes, brag.

It just sucks that it took cis wite women finally feeling the effects of not being able to find a decent cis wite man and being used by the types of moc woc warn each other to stay away from for the conversation about the stigmas against single women and removing the stigma away from single women to finally start happening. Asian and swana women both in and outside of asianswana countries have been dealing with this for several decades and slowly and quietly doing 4b-like movements years before 4b was even a thing in south korea. But despite numerous evidence stating that most asian women are single or married to asian men and that asian women are more loyal to asian men than vice versa, people would rather believe the asian anti-feminist myths and asian male misogyny slop falsely claiming that asian gals are ""anti-asian-male and more conservative than asian guys and more likely to end up with a non-asian guy than an asian guy"" than listening to the studies showing that more asian women are becoming single than married to a man and that the interracial statistics got skewed when they included multiracial people into communities of color and didn\'t bother to differentiate between the various groups and that asian women are actually way more progressive than asian men especially cis straight asian men. Multiracial asian women are the ones who are way more likely to have a non-asian male partner than pan-asian asian women and non-mixed asian women, yet non-mixed asian women get harassed the most for having a non-asian male partner. Black and asian manospheres love using skewed misinterpretations of interracial dating and marriage statistics to target and humiliate asian and black women in different ways while secretly pining for cis wite women and secretly aligning with wite and non-asianblack manospheres and publicly pretending to hate them and use their non-wite identites to get away with anti-feminism and misogyny against asian and black women - perpetuating anti-asian-female slop propaganda and misogynoir even further and both demonizing and using single asian women and single black women as fetish revenge tools. And don\'t get me started on how wite gals, especially cis wite gals, are extremely useful tools and agents in the manosphere and are way more valued and useful in manospheres of color than in the wite manosphere. And it is not a coincidence that the stigma against single women started to decrease the moment millenial and zoomer gals became old enough to voice their beliefs articulatly, have jobs, and vote. Hopefully this keeps up. And i am guessing that the topic of the article is not related to gay guys, lesbians, or non-binary folks who do not have boyfriends.']"

I cant drive because of my disability. i also cant go places alone safely because of my disability. when i wasn't in a relationship i had a couple friends willing to help me out or everything had to be within walkingwheeling distance of my home i use both a cane and a wheelchair. My time would be super limited as i needed to leave early so i could get home safe. When i got into a relationship i had someone willing and happy to help me go to places but i cant just treat my partner like a servant so naturally i need to be able to bring them too so they can also have fun. If you want me at a girls night? you are either picking me up yourself or dealing with my partner crashing a bit unless you are close by which my nearest friend is a 45 minute drive so none of my friends are near by. so when this mentality is the norm it naturally leads to disabled people getting shamed for doing what they need to to be able to exist in public. 1727 just wanna put here i totally agree with you. But be aware sadly in America at least disabled people basically loose their disability benefits they are not allowed a combined wealth of over 3,000 dollars and most of the time the person you are withs income can also disqualify you, and since part of benefits is our health insurance that can be a death sentence if your partners work doesnt offer healthcare when they get married forcing them to be finically reliant so for a lot of disabled people its never get marriage and that legal protection for your union but have money of your own or have your love but risk your safety. to make it worse disabled people are more likely to be domestically abused. So disabled people don't have equal marriage rights because of this. so that advice while def important, can only ring true for all of us when everyone has marriage equality."", 'Girl, I get the main point of having a boyfriend is embarrassing and that most men keep taking and taking. But let us not say all men. women do get tangible benefits such as money and gifts from boyfriends. Also, women need to realise that men will literally leave you once you are not attractive. They actually believe that the value of women depletes completely at 30. They arent lying and you need to pay attention. They like your youth, your labour and your body, and as young as they can get. They will never ever recognise your labour but will forever talk about how they bring home food and give you shelter. Now, men want all the benefits of a wife like access to your body and daily labour and bearing your children but without marring you so he can exit without consequences any day. And girls, some of you let that happen to you. You know when they say we demand 50-50 custody of the children? well, half of them dont want the children, much less take care of them. The saying dad went out to get milk is so popular because it is true. Men claim that children of single fathers do much better 🤣 that is where I laugh so hard. They say they are logicalbut the thing is, they cant do simple math or they outright refuse to do the math! More than 80 percent of single parents are single mothers! The fathers that actually step up for the kids are the fathers that actually want to take care of the kids. So they have the intention to be better parents to the children. On top of that, most of the single fathers have help too. They kids are looked after by their girlfriends or the new step mom or the grandma. Whereas, mothers are the default parents whether they want the kids or not , teenage rape victim single moms included. Single mothers also cannot trust men near their kids. If there were proper studies, there are tonnes of successful children from single mother households but they will rather stick to the data that fit their narrative. And dont even get me started on alimony matters.', ""You see, THIS is EXACTLY why men have ALREADY LEFT this so-called dating marriage crap pool. Good men aren't interested nor care about the majority of females anymore. Have you still not noticed till now? Majority of w0men today are not worth all the BS, attitude, selfishness, manipulation, self-contradicting, childish, illogical non*sense anymore to men. The most ridiculous thing is that it WILL be these very SAME females who in just 2-5yrs will start crying on social media, complaining bitterly that men dont acknowledge, approach or want anything to do with them - with their biological clock ticking loudly from 25- 35yrs. Lonely, depressed, miserable, terrified of dying alone, no husband, no man, no child, no babies, and def no boyfriend. Then they become 'cat or dog mums' with boxes of wine for company. This is the truth and pattern we are all seeing. It seems w0men are totally incapable of learning lessons from past mistakes to make better decisions for the future. First it was the disaster of poular femini*sm, and now its this? popular Vogue?🤷🤪 It sounds like delusion and cope mechanism to me. Wondering now if having a boyfriend is a good thing IS ALREADY too late, ladies. Why? Bcos men checked out ages ago. Makes one wonder? Now there'll be no men around for most you to even have the possibility of posting about.. even if you wanted to. Winter IS here and will be soooo cold, you'll have nobody to blame but yourselves. Enjoy your 17 cats, many of you ladies. Men Are Already Done. Just unbelievable, really😮😮😅😅""]"

People nowadays is always looking at their screen, they look and scroll more that screen than they look people to the our eyes or faces, to much people is anything doesn\'t exist on internet then doesn\'t exist, or is not worthy, so what\'s the benefit on posting happy photos of a relationship? You never know who is jealous, maybe even she is your friend and you doesn\'t imagine it, maybe even your family wants to ruin your relationship for personal gain, so what\'s the use? Real people who love you will be happy for both of you, but you\'re exposing that pictures literally to anyone, not only people who love you, but enemies or unkow people The real thing is men almost never write dm to a girl if they know she is in a relationship, and isn\'t because they are more considerate or less selfish, is because they definitly HATE the fact of think in a woman being with the power to choose between more than a men or having more than one, that\'s why our sexuality was controled since the begining of the story with violence, in some countries with extreme violence. By the other way, most of men are bad in the bed too, so when we see a men in longs or happy relationship, we tend to think that the men have to be god in bed or a good person, wich make them more interesting and probably result in dms for him from woman who doesn\'t care or enjoy the idea of ruining the relationship to feel power or rise a poor self steem The self steem of woman in general is literally in ruins thanks to the highs standars of beauty so I find normal other many woman doesn\'t want or think is a good idea to post, and isn\'t about of ""being insecure"" is about doesn\'t want bad energy sourrounded good vives or happyness, in life there\'s a lot of bad energy we can\'t avoid, why search for it? Most of guys too responde every dm they get and flirt any girls while they gaslight their partners and call us insecure, crazy, not enought to be upset...""It\'s about a matter of trust"" people say, but you never can trust by the way, and in case you catch them the only thing you\'ll get is gaslight, many women had feel the need to control the phone, going in toxic behaviour, so what\'s the use? A men who you can trust, who not lie and not gaslight, who you never feel insecure or feel need to control, and you can post 99999 photos knowing there\'s no danger because even if 90 woman dm him with bad intentions he\'s not gonna awnser or fall into the trap, yeah that\'s the ideal, and that\'s is what we want but where is that man? If exist, there must be only a few, men are less judged by infidelity so they don\'t care, they\'re not gona lose friends or status.', '1.
